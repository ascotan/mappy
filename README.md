This project builds fantasy terrain as an SVG image that can be scaled or printed.  Inspiration
for this project comes from:

- https://mewo2.com/notes/terrain/
- http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/

Obviously i'm terrible at naming things. Maybe I'll fix that at some point. The code is all client side.
